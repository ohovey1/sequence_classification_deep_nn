# Sequence Classification Using LSTM - Taxi Driver Trajectories

## Goal

The goal of this project is to take on a sequence classification task using deep learning. Given a dataset containing five taxi drivers' daily driving trajectories for 6 months, the objective is to build a NN to predict which driver a trajectory belongs to based on the testing set.
-----------------------------------
## Proposal

Since we are dealing with a sequence classification task, my proposal is that an LSTM network will best capture the sequential nature of the dataset. 

This repository is organized as follows:

    -- data
        -- {csv files containing data}
    -- data_loader.py
    -- models.py
    -- evaluation.py

## Methodology

### Data Preperation

Data loading and preprocessing steps are handled in the data_loader.py file. The following preprocessing steps were taken:
